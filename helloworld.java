class Hello {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
  System.out.println("Hey you guys!!!!!");
 }
};

// this looks sorta similar to C# with the class and the main. In C#, the print
// is a Console.Writeline("Hello"). But since Console is a part of System in C#,
// the System.out.println in Java makes a little more sense.
